        Hi my name is Anosh Malik!
        I'm 28 years old and currently living in Sheffield, UK. Sheffield is known as the "Steel City" due to it's long and glorious past of producing steel during the industrial revolution, and ending as recently as the 1970's. This city has alot to offer, not just jobs and accommodation but a great sense of community for all it’s inhabitants.  I went to Abbeydale Grange School where I studied Electronics, Art, Graphic Design for GCSE and then Longley Park College for A Levels where I studied Electronics, Physics and Maths.
I’m originally from Lahore, Pakistan and moved to Sheffield when I was 14 and have been living here since. Sheffield is what I call home. Being a Christian I attend church regularly and it keeps me grounded, not to be swayed in either direction too much and that’s what makes faith important in the modern day world where life keeps pulling us all from all sides.

My interests in tech range from hardware to software and my preference is creating interactive media such as games and animations. I use Unity engine for the former and Adobe After Effects for the latter. The link for some short experimental animations is below:

Among software development activities I’ve done, most of my work has been experimental, ranging from using Arduino/Raspberry Pi to setting up Apache web servers using AWS with Wordpress. I have used LG WebOs SDK for making apps for my tv, but ran out of patience due to a lack of skill when it comes to JS as most of it is web-based.
My first program was written in Assembly during A Level Electronics in 2012, around 10 years ago, while I was also learning HTML5/CSS3 during my Computing class. My most recent piece of code was written in C# for Unity engine when I made a experimental Roulette game for Android that uses finger gestures(swipes) to rotate the wheel.
I started to work as Technical Support for Team Knowhow, part of Curry’s PC World and stayed there for 3 years till the end of 2018.Started in Sept 2015 and ended in Dec 2018. I learned troubleshooting skills involved in lots of aspects of tech, including diagnosing problems with websites, mobile devices from iOS and android to Windows Phone, computers running Mac and Windows and practically any other electronic hardware/software sold at Currys.

    <p class="text">  
My goal in life is to make it as a senior developer at established companies or in the public sector working for government departments, as a way to prove my skillset and to achieve my career goal of attaining a higher position. Since I have to start somewhere, I decided to join Code Your Future to give myself a fighting chance to land that dream role by being involved in a team environment rather than experimenting with different technologies on my own. Being a solo developer can be boring at times as there isn’t a group to engage with, to bang heads together and resolve issues together. Most of the onus for projects is on one person and that can be a little hectic and stressful, so in my opinion I’d prefer a team setting.
I’d like to be involved in new technologies surrounding cloud computing and  web 3.0, and being involved in data visualisation as well as animations made using CSS and JS.
I believe this course will be great in progressing as a full-stack developer and give me the foundational to advanced skills to undertake such tasks as mentioned above.
